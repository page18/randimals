## 🚀 Getting started

In the `/assets` folder, JavaScript file `main.js` contains the code to use Randimals. However, we must bundle this code into `bundle.js` with the Randimals package included so that it can function correctly in the browser. To do so, run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Afterwards, you can simply serve the contents of this repository as a static site.
